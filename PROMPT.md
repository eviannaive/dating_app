# Dating App Overview: AI Romance

## 1. Overall Goal

This document outlines the plan for creating a mobile dating application using Flutter. The app will allow users to interact with AI characters in a romantic context. The focus will be on user personalization, security, and scalability.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary users are single individuals aged 20-40 who are interested in exploring relationships with AI-driven characters.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: Flutter (for cross-platform compatibility on iOS and Android)
*   **Backend**: To be connected via a RESTful API (URL to be provided). All data interactions will be handled through this API.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. User Authentication & Profile Management

*   **Registration/Login**:
    *   Email and password-based registration and login.
    *   (Optional) Third-party login with Google and Facebook.
*   **Profile Creation**:
    *   A guided process for users to enter their basic information (name, age, gender, city, and a short bio).
*   **Profile Editing**:
    *   Users can update their personal information and upload/manage multiple photos.
*   **Interests and Preferences**:
    *   Users can select from a list of interest tags.
    *   Users can set preferences for matching (e.g., age range, gender of AI characters).

### 4.2. Matching System

*   **Swipe Interface**:
    *   A card-based UI where users can swipe right to "like" an AI character or left to "pass".
    *   Liking an AI character will initiate a chat.
*   **AI Character Script**:
    *   A generic script will be created for the initial interaction with the AI characters to guide the conversation.

### 4.3. Real-time Chat

*   **Chat List**:
    *   A screen that displays all ongoing conversations with AI characters, similar to a standard messaging app.
*   **One-on-One Chat Room**:
    *   A private chat room is created automatically after a match.
*   **Messaging**:
    *   Real-time text messaging with send/receive functionality.
*   **Timestamps**:
    *   Each message will have a timestamp.
*   **Unread Message Indicators**:
    *   The app will track the chat history and indicate unread messages.

### 4.4. Push Notifications

*   **New Message Alerts**:
    *   Push notifications will be sent to the user when they receive a new message.

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

*   **Theme**: A romantic and visually appealing design.
*   **User Flow**: The app will have a smooth and intuitive user experience.
*   **Security**: All user data will be encrypted and handled in accordance with privacy best practices.
*   **Performance**: The app will be optimized for fast response times and efficient resource usage.
*   **Scalability**: The architecture will be designed to accommodate future features such as voice/video chat, virtual gifts, and community events.
